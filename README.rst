The Repository Service for TUF Command Line Interface (CLI) is a CLI Python
application to manage the Repository Service for TUF.

The CLI supports the initial setup, termed a ceremony, where the first repository
metadata are signed and the service is configured, generating tokens to be used
by integration (i.e., CI/CD tools).

This CLI is part of the Repository Service for TUF (RSTUF).
